# Abstract

## Background and Problem Statement:
Tourists visiting Morocco often face challenges in accessing comprehensive, real-time information about attractions and cultural sites. Traditional guidebooks can be outdated or limited in scope, and human tour guides may not always be available or affordable. Additionally, tourists may struggle to identify landmarks in their photos, and they might desire to enhance their travel photos by removing distractions or improving resolution. A solution is needed to provide tourists with an intuitive, accessible, and interactive resource for exploring Morocco.

## Impact and Proposed Solution
Our solution, Touristance, is an innovative multimodal chatbot that accepts text, speech, and image inputs, providing tourists with instant access to information about Moroccan attractions. By leveraging semantic search, speech-to-text, and multimodal language modeling techniques, Touristance will offer responses in both text and speech formats. Additionally, it will process images, identifying landmarks, and enhancing photos based on user queries.
This tool will revolutionize the way tourists interact with their travel environment, providing a richer, more immersive experience. Not only will it increase visitor satisfaction and engagement, but it will also promote a deeper appreciation and understanding of Moroccan culture and heritage. With its photo-enhancement capabilities, Touristance can also enhance the quality of travel photography, creating more vivid memories for tourists.

## Project Outcomes and deliverables
We deliver a chatbot capable of:
1. Responding to user queries in text and speech formats.
2. Identifying Moroccan landmarks from user-uploaded images and providing relevant information.
3. Enhancing user-uploaded images by editing them.
