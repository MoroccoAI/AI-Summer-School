## Abstract

This solution proposes the automation of medical prescription and drug
availability processes using optical character recognition (OCR) and natural 
language processing (NLP). By transforming written prescriptions into understandable
text through OCR, and then using NLP to extract essential information like drug names,
dosage, and administration frequency, patients are provided with an easier way to 
comprehend their medical instructions. Moreover, the extracted information can be 
utilized to search and recommend available pharmacies based on location, drug price, 
and other considerations. The system offers benefits for both patients and pharmacists:
patients can conveniently find the required drugs, reducing the need for visiting multiple
pharmacies, while pharmacists can decrease the instances of unavailable drug inquiries,
thereby enabling more time for patient care tasks.
