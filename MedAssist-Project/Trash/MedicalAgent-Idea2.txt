MedAgent: AI-Powered Medical Agent for Enhanced Healthcare Decision-Making

Description:

Our project aims to develop an advanced AI-Powered Medical Image Analysis and Symptom Support Agent that can cater to both doctors and patients, empowering them with valuable insights for accurate disease diagnosis and informed healthcare decisions. Leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, this agent will be versatile, accepting multiple inputs like medical images, audio recordings, and text descriptions to provide personalized support to patients and assist doctors in their clinical practices, with a focus on the healthcare context in Morocco (Darija).

Objectives:

1. **Comprehensive Medical Image Analysis:** The AI agent will be capable of analyzing medical images, including X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, to detect abnormalities, identify diseases, and provide diagnostic support for both doctors and patients.

2. **Multimodal Symptom Analysis:** Patients will have the ability to describe their symptoms using natural language or even provide audio descriptions. The agent will utilize these inputs to identify potential medical conditions and provide relevant advice for self-assessment or further medical consultation.

3. **Natural Language Interaction:** The AI agent will be equipped with a conversational user interface, enabling seamless communication with patients and doctors alike. Patients can interact with the system through simple and intuitive prompts, making it accessible to users of varying technical backgrounds.

4. **Adaptive Tool Selection:** Based on the input type (images, audio, or text), the agent will dynamically select the appropriate tools for medical image analysis or symptom evaluation. It will leverage HuggingFace Transformers' curated tools for image segmentation, natural language understanding, and audio processing.

5. **Interpretability and Transparency:** The agent's decisions and recommendations will be interpretable and transparent, providing clear explanations for its responses. This will foster trust and understanding in both patients and doctors, enhancing the overall user experience.

6. **Ethical Considerations:** Ensuring patient privacy, confidentiality, and ethical use of AI in healthcare will be paramount. The agent will adhere to strict data security measures and promote responsible AI practices.

7. **Educational Support:** The agent will not only provide diagnostic support but also offer educational insights to patients and doctors, improving health literacy and facilitating shared decision-making.

Feasibility:

Our project is designed to be feasible within the duration of the summer school. We will focus on developing a functional prototype that demonstrates the agent's capability to analyze medical images, process symptom descriptions, and provide relevant support and advice. While the agent's full deployment and integration may require further refinement, we aim to showcase substantial progress by the end of the week.

Innovation:

Our project brings innovation by creating an adaptive AI-Powered Medical Image Analysis and Symptom Support Agent that caters to both patients and doctors. By providing multimodal inputs and personalized support, the agent empowers patients to be proactive in their health and enables doctors to make well-informed clinical decisions.

Honesty:

We acknowledge that AI-powered medical image analysis and symptom assessment already exist, but our project aims to integrate these capabilities into a unified, user-friendly, and adaptable AI Agent for broader medical support. The focus is on providing a reliable and ethical tool that enhances healthcare decision-making for all stakeholders involved.
