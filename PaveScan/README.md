## Abstract

This project aims at improving road safety through the implementation of a SAM-Track (Segment and Track Anything) model for the segmentation and tracking of delineate hazardous elements within road scenes in real-time.

Road hazards pose a critical and escalating threat to public health and safety worldwide, necessitating urgent attention and innovative solutions. This project advocates for the widespread adoption of image segmentation techniques as a powerful and cost-effective tool to identify and mitigate road hazards effectively.
