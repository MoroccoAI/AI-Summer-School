#### Problem Statement:
Long-form audio content, such as podcasts and educational courses, often contains a wealth of valuable information. 
However, accessing specific segments or seeking relevant information within these lengthy audio files can be time-consuming and tedious for users 
#### Problem Solution and Impact:
Our project aims to develop a solution that enables users to effortlessly search for and retrieve specific information within long audio content by utilizing a chatbot interface. 
The system enables users to quickly find specific information within audio files. Whether it's a student looking for information in a lengthy course lecture, a home cook searching for a particular recipe ingredient in a recorded cooking tutorial, or any other scenario, this application will streamline the process of finding relevant information within audio recordings.
