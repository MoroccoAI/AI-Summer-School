# `Problem statement`

In the rapidly evolving retail landscape, customers often face overwhelming choices when shopping for clothing items in physical stores. The absence of personalized recommendations tailored to individual preferences and fashion trends creates a significant challenge for customers in finding the right clothing items which leads to frustration, decreased customer satisfaction, and potential loss of sales for the store.
Moreover, store staff may struggle to provide effective recommendations due to limited knowledge of individual customer preferences and current fashion trends, as well as the large-scale store inventory in some cases. This results in missed opportunities to enhance the customer experience and foster brand loyalty.
