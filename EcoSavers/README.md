### Integrated Waste Management System for Morocco using Satellite Data and Advanced AI Techniques

## Team : Eco savers
**Abstract**: In Morocco, waste management practices face significant challenges, particularly in terms of poor waste distribution, understanding of waste structure and collection efficiency. The poor distribution of landfill sites poses a significant challenge to the environment, agriculture, and public health, due to the infiltration of wastewater and foul odors. To address these challenges, this project aims to improve landfill management practices in Morocco through three key areas. Firstly, the project seeks to develop methods for detecting and locating illegal landfills in the country. Secondly, the project aims to implement forecasting techniques to predict future waste accumulation and optimize landfill capacity. Thirdly, the project aims to identify and address cases where landfills have been incorrectly placed or located. The proposed solutions are having a considerable impact. By detecting illegal landfill sites, the project contributes to improving public health by mitigating emissions of atmospheric pollutants, reducing the risk of respiratory illnesses, and improving the general well-being of the community. In addition, protecting water sources by accurately locating landfills helps to preserve water quality, protect ecosystems, and support sustainable development. The ultimate goal is to provide a complete solution for accurate mapping, forecasting and optimization of solid waste management strategies in Morocco.
